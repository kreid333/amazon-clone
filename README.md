## Installation

To use this application, run 'npm install' to install all of the packages listed as dependencies for both the server and React.

## Usage 

The user must run `npm start` in order to start both the Express server and the React client simultaneously. The main functionality of the application can be accessed if the user decides to create an account or not. However, guests do not have a Your Orders page, as they have no account associated with their order.

To test payment proccessing, use the test card number 4242 4242 4242 4242, a random three-digit CVC number, and any expiration date.

Instead of running locally, the application can also be ran here:
